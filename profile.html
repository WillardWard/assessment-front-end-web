    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
      <p>I would like to be apart of a company which gives back to the world in some way. Ideally, I would be able to move up and help manage a team, as I have always been skilled at bringing people together. Finding a career which gives me purpose, but still allows for my own personal adventures is something I strive for. Of course, stable income and job security are important for me as well. Also, a career which challenges me both intellectually and creatively would be a great fit.</p>
